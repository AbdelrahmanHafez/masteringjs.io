In this article, you'll learn how to upload a file from Node.js to [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) using the [official AWS Node.js SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk). This article assumes you already have an S3 bucket in AWS. If you don't, please follow the [AWS tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#create-bucket-intro).

Below is a basic example of uploading your current `package.json` to an S3 bucket. You'll need 3 environment variables to run the below script:

- `AWS_BUCKET` is the name of your AWS bucket. Buckets are like top-level folders for S3. The key detail is that S3 bucket names must be unique across all of S3.
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. You can get these by clicking on "Security Credentials" on your [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com).

Here's a basic script that uploads your `package.json` to S3. Note that the S3 SDK currently does **not** support [promises](/tutorials/fundamentals/promise).

```javascript
[require:Node.*s3.*upload]
```

By default, the file you upload will be private. In other words, opening up `https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/<bucket>/package.json` in your browser will give you an error. To make the file public, you need to [set the `ACL` option to `'public-read'`](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=116231) as shown below.

```javascript
[require:Node.*s3.*public upload]
```
